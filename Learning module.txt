20. get element in javascriprt
   document.getElementsByTagName it will return an array of all element with same tagb name  so  if we have to give an property then we will eccess it by index number.
   document.getElelmentsByClassName("Here we Enter class name use to access specific unique element ");
   document.getElementById("We will got a unique ID element.");
   after all these is we will use '.' and give  a property to this sepcified element.

   document.querySelector("h1");we will sleect a sleector or class or id to select if we want an specific element then it will used as "li a";
   W can also use combine selector using class or id with selector
